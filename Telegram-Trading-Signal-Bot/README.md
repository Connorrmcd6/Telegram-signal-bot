This repository contains two relatively simple telegram bots which can messages to a telegram user or group when certain buy/sell conditions are met. It is recommended to run the bot on Windows task scheduler or with a cronjob for Linux/Mac users 

BotimusPrime: Integrates with the Binance API to pull data and analyse it based on your strategy, currently it is using a very basic strategy with MACD, RSI and Chaikin Oscillator.

BumbleBot: Integrates with the Yahoo Finance API via yfinance Libary. Operates exactly the same as a Botimus but anlayses stock prices rather than crypto. 

Backtester Script: find the symbol you want to back test on yahoo finance, and update your intervals, timelines, strategy accordingly.
